# Premium System Implementation Status

## Current Issue
Premium detection is not working correctly. The toggle in the subscription page doesn't properly control premium features.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Trial Override**: Premium detection shows `trialActive: true` which overrides the `premium_addon: false` setting
2. **Database Migration**: The `premium_addon` field was added but trial logic takes precedence
3. **Premium Logic**: `hasPremium = org.premium_addon || (org.seat_cap >= 100) || trialActive`

## Debug Output (Current)
```
Premium access calculation: {
  premium_addon: false,
  seat_cap: 10, 
  trialActive: true,
  hasPremium: true  // <-- This should be false when premium toggled off
}
```

## Expected Premium System Behavior

### Premium OFF (Non-Premium Users):
- ‚ùå **NO purple AI Insights buttons** on any pages (dashboard, accounts, engagements, contacts, calendar)
- ‚úÖ **Crown icons show** next to Goals, Analytics, Surveys, AI Insights in sidebar üëë
- ‚úÖ **Clicking premium sidebar items** ‚Üí shows upgrade prompts in main content area
- ‚úÖ **API Protection** ‚Üí 402 errors for premium APIs (prevents shell/curl access)
- ‚úÖ **Page Access** ‚Üí Goals/Analytics/Surveys/AI Insights pages show FeatureGate upgrade prompts

### Premium ON (Premium Users):
- ‚úÖ **Purple AI Insights buttons show** on all pages with Sparkles icon ‚ú®
- ‚ùå **No crown icons** anywhere in sidebar
- ‚úÖ **AI Insights removed from sidebar** completely (since buttons are on pages)
- ‚úÖ **Full access** to Goals/Analytics/Surveys pages (no upgrade prompts)
- ‚úÖ **Full API access** to premium endpoints
- ‚úÖ **AI Insights modal** shows actual insights (not upgrade prompts)

## Files Modified for Premium System

### API Routes with Premium Protection:
- `app/api/goals/route.ts` - Protected with `goals_management` feature check
- `app/api/analytics/stats-dynamic/route.ts` - Protected with `advanced_analytics` feature check  
- `app/api/admin/automation/route.ts` - Protected with `automation` feature check
- `app/api/features/premium/route.ts` - **CREATED** - Returns premium status for UI components

### UI Components:
- `components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` - Shows/hides crown icons based on premium status
- `components/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx` - AI Insights button (shows unconditionally)
- `components/accounts/account-list.tsx` - AI Insights button (shows unconditionally)
- `components/accounts/account-details.tsx` - AI Insights button (shows unconditionally)
- `components/engagements/engagement-list.tsx` - AI Insights button (shows unconditionally)
- `components/contacts/contacts-page-wrapper.tsx` - AI Insights button (shows unconditionally)
- `components/calendar/calendar-client.tsx` - AI Insights button (shows unconditionally)

### Pages with FeatureGate:
- `app/dashboard/goals/page.tsx` - Uses FeatureGate for `goals_management`
- `app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx` - Uses FeatureGate for `advanced_analytics`
- `app/dashboard/surveys/page.tsx` - Uses FeatureGate for `surveys`
- `app/dashboard/ai-insights/page.tsx` - **CREATED** - Uses FeatureGate for `ai_insights`

### Core System:
- `lib/features.ts` - Premium detection logic (needs trial override fix)
- `components/feature-gate.tsx` - Shows upgrade prompts for non-premium users
- `components/ai/ai-insights-modal.tsx` - Has built-in premium checking

## Required Fixes

### 1. Trial Override Issue
The trial period is currently overriding the premium toggle. Need to either:
- **Option A**: Run SQL to end trial: `UPDATE organizations SET trial_ends_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'`
- **Option B**: Modify premium logic to respect premium_addon toggle even during trial
- **Option C**: Add UI indication that trial includes premium (so toggle has no effect during trial)

### 2. Premium Logic Fix Needed
Current logic in `lib/features.ts`:
```typescript
const hasPremium = org.premium_addon || (org.seat_cap >= 100) || trialActive
```

Might need to change to prioritize toggle during trial:
```typescript 
const hasPremium = org.premium_addon || (org.seat_cap >= 100) || (trialActive && org.premium_addon !== false)
```

### 3. Database Migration Status
- ‚úÖ `premium_addon` field exists in database
- ‚úÖ Subscription toggle saves to database correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Trial period overrides the toggle (by design or bug?)

## Test Card for Payment Testing
Use Stripe test card: `4242424242424242` with any future expiry and any CVC.

## Premium Features List

## Next Session TODO
1. Fix trial override issue (choose option A, B, or C above)
2. Test premium toggle works correctly
3. Verify crown icons show/hide properly
4. Verify AI Insights buttons show/hide correctly
5. Test API 402 errors when premium is off
6. Test upgrade prompts in FeatureGate pages
