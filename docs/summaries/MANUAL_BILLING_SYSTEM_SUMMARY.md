# Manual Billing System Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **System Overview**

The manual billing system has been successfully implemented to give Fastenr operations complete control over customer billing. The system enforces business rules while providing comprehensive billing management through the super admin dashboard.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Components**

### **Database Schema**
- **`billing_periods`**: Tracks monthly billing cycles and license change limits
- **`billing_events`**: Enhanced with period tracking and license change flags  
- **`billing_restrictions`**: Enforces business rules (one license change per month)
- **Enhanced `organizations`**: Added billing status and payment method tracking

### **API Endpoints**
- **`/api/super-admin/billing`**: Comprehensive billing operations API
  - GET: Billing dashboard data with organization summaries
  - POST: Bulk billing actions (generate invoices, process payments, send emails)

### **UI Components**
- **`BillingDashboard`**: Full-featured billing operations interface
- **Enhanced `SuperAdminPortal`**: Integrated billing tab with operations controls

## 🔒 **Security & Business Rules**

### **Access Control**
- Super admin access restricted to Fastenr staff emails only
- All billing actions logged in `super_admin_audit` table
- Two-factor confirmation for critical operations

### **License Change Restrictions**
- **Maximum one license change per billing period**
- Database functions enforce restrictions: `can_change_license()`, `record_license_change()`
- Subscription API validates changes before allowing updates

### **Billing Scenarios Handled**

#### **1. Trial to Paid Conversion**
- Bills from trial end date to current month end
- Prorated billing based on actual days used
- Example: 16 days of 25 seats = £323 (51.6% of £625 monthly)

#### **2. License Changes Mid-Month**
- Prorated billing for each seat count period
- Previous count billed up to change date
- New count billed from change date to month end
- Example: 15 seats (14 days) + 30 seats (16 days) = £556 total

#### **3. Standard Monthly Billing**
- Full monthly amount for current seat count
- 20% VAT automatically calculated
- Premium features included at 100+ seats
- Example: 150 seats × £35 + 20% VAT = £6,300

## 🎛️ **Super Admin Dashboard Features**

- **Bulk Actions**: Generate invoices, process payments, send emails
- **Payment Validation**: Checks for valid payment methods before billing

### **Organization Status Indicators**

## 📊 **Operational Workflow**

4. **Generate Invoices**: Create invoices with proper line items and VAT
5. **Process Payments**: Charge payment methods via Stripe
6. **Send Notifications**: Email invoices to customers
7. **Monitor Collections**: Track payment status and follow up on failures

### **License Change Management**

2. **System Validates**: Checks one-change-per-month limit
3. **Records Change**: Logs in billing events with effective date
4. **Billing Calculation**: Prorates charges for different periods
5. **Invoice Generation**: Creates detailed line items for each period

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Functions**
```sql
-- Get current billing period for organization
get_current_billing_period(org_id UUID)

-- Check if license change is allowed
can_change_license(org_id UUID) 

-- Record license change with validation
record_license_change(org_id, old_count, new_count, user_id)

-- Generate comprehensive billing summary
get_billing_summary()
```

### **Billing Calculations**
- **Proration**: Days in period / Days in month × Monthly amount
- **VAT**: 20% added to all amounts
- **Enterprise Pricing**: £35/seat for 100+ seats, £25/seat for <100 seats
- **Premium Inclusion**: Automatic at 100+ seats

### **Security Measures**
- **Super Admin Restriction**: Only Fastenr staff can access billing
- **Action Logging**: All operations logged with user, IP, timestamp
- **Validation Checks**: Payment methods, billing eligibility, change limits
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental bulk operations
