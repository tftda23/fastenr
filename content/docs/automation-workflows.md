# Automation & Workflows

Automation is key to scaling your customer success operations efficiently. With Fastenr's workflow automation, you can reduce manual tasks, ensure consistent processes, and respond to customer needs more quickly.

## What is Workflow Automation?

Workflow automation allows you to:
- **Trigger actions** based on specific events
- **Reduce manual work** by automating repetitive tasks
- **Ensure consistency** in customer interactions
- **Scale operations** without growing team size proportionally

## Core Components

Every workflow consists of three elements:

### 1. Triggers
Events that start a workflow:
- Customer health score changes
- New customer onboarding
- Survey responses
- Support ticket creation
- Contract renewal dates
- Usage pattern changes

### 2. Conditions
Criteria that must be met:
- Customer segment
- Contract value
- Health score thresholds
- Time-based conditions
- Custom field values
- Integration data

### 3. Actions
What happens when triggered:
- Send emails
- Create tasks
- Update customer records
- Notify team members
- Generate reports
- Update external systems

## Common Workflow Examples

### Onboarding Automation

**Trigger**: New customer added
**Conditions**: Contract value > $5,000
**Actions**:
1. Send welcome email sequence
2. Create onboarding tasks for CSM
3. Schedule 30-day check-in
4. Add to onboarding dashboard

### Health Score Alerts

**Trigger**: Health score drops below 60
**Conditions**: Customer tier = Enterprise
**Actions**:
1. Notify account manager immediately
2. Create high-priority task
3. Schedule intervention call
4. Add to at-risk customer list

### Renewal Preparation

**Trigger**: 90 days before contract end
**Conditions**: Any renewal approaching
**Actions**:
1. Generate renewal preparation checklist
2. Schedule stakeholder meeting
3. Prepare usage and value reports
4. Notify sales team

### Survey Follow-up

**Trigger**: NPS score submitted
**Conditions**: Score ≤ 6 (Detractor)
**Actions**:
1. Notify CSM within 1 hour
2. Create follow-up task
3. Send personalized response email
4. Schedule recovery call

## Setting Up Workflows

### Step-by-Step Creation

1. **Navigate to Automation > Workflows**
2. **Click "Create New Workflow"**
3. **Choose your trigger type**
4. **Set conditions** (if needed)
5. **Define actions** to take
6. **Test the workflow**
7. **Activate and monitor**

### Best Practices

**Start Simple**
- Begin with one trigger and one action
- Test thoroughly before activating
- Monitor performance initially

**Be Specific with Conditions**
- Use precise criteria to avoid unwanted triggers
- Consider edge cases
- Test with sample data

**Meaningful Actions**
- Ensure actions provide real value
- Avoid notification overload
- Make actions specific and actionable

## Advanced Workflow Features

### Multi-Step Workflows

Create complex sequences:

```
Trigger: Health score drops
↓
Condition: Score < 40
↓
Action 1: Send alert to CSM
↓
Wait: 24 hours
↓
Condition: Score still < 40
↓
Action 2: Escalate to manager
↓
Wait: 48 hours
↓
Action 3: Executive notification
```

### Branching Logic

Handle different scenarios:

```
Trigger: Survey response
↓
Condition: NPS 9-10? → Promoter actions
Condition: NPS 7-8?  → Passive actions  
Condition: NPS 0-6?  → Detractor actions
```

### Integration Actions
