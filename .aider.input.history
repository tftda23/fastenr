+for some reason /dashboard/billing shows the dashboard nav rather than the admin nav even though the nav item is in the admin nav perhaps because it is at the wrong route /dashboard/billing rather than /dashboard/admin/billing we dont want to break anything though if we move it we should also check for references etc and update as needed
