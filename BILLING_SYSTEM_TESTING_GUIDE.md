## 📊 **Expected Billing Calculations**

### **Trial to Paid Conversion**
- **NeverBilled Corp**: 25 seats, trial ended Jan 15
- **Billing Period**: Jan 15 - Jan 31 (16 days)
- **Calculation**: £625/month × (16/31 days) = £323
- **With VAT**: £323 × 1.2 = £388

### **License Change Billing**
- **LicenseChanged Inc**: 50 → 75 seats on Feb 15
- **Period 1**: 50 seats × 14 days = £452
- **Period 2**: 75 seats × 15 days = £906
- **Total**: £1,358 + VAT = £1,630

### **Enterprise Billing**
- **Enterprise Solutions**: 150 seats
- **Monthly**: 150 × £35 = £5,250
- **With VAT**: £5,250 × 1.2 = £6,300
